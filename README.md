What’s it about?
• I am not sure what the project is about, my supervisor just tasked me to work on
something that allow people to write code and execute them, and present to him after I
am done. There should also be buttons that can assist them in some ways in writing
codes. I supposed my supervisor is considering whether he wants me to take part in this
project or not, since he did not tell me what this project is about.
What did you do?
•My supervisor did not specifically say how the project should look like, so I take
inspirations from W3Schools html editor. I created a web page using html, css, JS which
has buttons, html editor, an explaination area and another area to show the executed
codes. Everything works, like the editor can write code and user can see the codes
running on the right by pressing the “RUN” button on the top of the editor. Buttons
when pressed will display text explaining what this button does and it also sends codes
to the editor. For instance, if I pressed the button called “Paragraph”, I will see a
paragraph tag in the editor and an explaination text telling me this button will create a
paragraph tag in the editor once pressed.
What did you learn?
• I learn how to create html editor by using JavaScript and add text into the editor by
using JavaScript for loop. I also learn how to assign multiple task function to buttons
that can do many jobs at once.
Did you face any challenges? How did you overcome them?
• Yes I did faced a few challenges but I managed to solve them by myself eventually.
One of the challenges were the buttons can display text explaining what this particular
button does but will not be shown in the editor as code. To solve this, I tried to
understand why my codes not working as intended. Then I realized that maybe is 
because the codes I am using is not suitable, so I modified the codes and added
JavaScript codes that can prompted the button to do two tasks. One task is to display an
explanation text and the other is to send codes to the editor.
